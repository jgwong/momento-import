# momento-import

On my iPhone 3G I used <a href="http://momentoapp.com/">Momento app</a> as my journal. It exported text files and I wanted to import them into my diary directory quickly and painlessly, because when it begins to take a certain measure of work, it stays undone in my To Do list for, like, forever. Sometimes I wrote a diary entry on the PC and another on my iPhone on the same date, so I needed both entries to be together.

Also, my diary entries always have the date on the first line.
